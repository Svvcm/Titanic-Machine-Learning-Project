# Titanic-Machine-Learning-Project

# Overview
This project focuses on analyzing and predicting the survival outcomes of passengers on the Titanic using machine learning techniques. By examining the factors that influenced survival, we aim to gain insights from historical data while enhancing our data analysis skills.

# Dataset Description

The dataset, obtained from Kaggle, includes the following features for each passenger:

 PassengerId: Unique identifier for each passenger.
 Survived: Survival status (0 = No, 1 = Yes).
 Pclass: Ticket class (1st, 2nd, or 3rd).
 Name: Full name of the passenger.
 Sex: Gender of the passenger.
 Age: Age in years.
 SibSp: Number of siblings/spouses aboard.
 Parch: Number of parents/children aboard.
 Ticket: Ticket number.
 Fare: Ticket fare.
 Cabin: Cabin number.
 Embarked: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton).

 # Project goals
1.Data Exploration: Understand the dataset through descriptive statistics and visualization.
2.Data Cleaning: Handle missing values and prepare the dataset for analysis.
3.Model Training: Implement machine learning algorithms to predict survival.
4.Evaluation: Assess model performance using accuracy and other metrics.

# Getting Started

To run this project, clone the repository and ensure you have the necessary libraries installed, including Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn. Follow the instructions in the Jupyter notebook to load the data and begin analysis.
